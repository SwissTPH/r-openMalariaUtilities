** TODO Add stylr and lintr defaults

So the settings used in this project are easily available
** TODO Make cache portable

Currently, the cache is (most likely) not portable between UNIX and Windows
systems as the paths are stored as an absolute value and thus the seperators
etc. become hardcoded.
Possible circumvention: Only store the path segments from the root directory and
use them in conjunction with ~file.path~.
