# How to contribtute

## Code style

We follow the [google style
guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html), with the following
differences:

- `camelCase` for functions and variable names
  - `snake_case` can be used for exported functions as an alias

Use styler and lintr for syntax checking and automatic formatting.
